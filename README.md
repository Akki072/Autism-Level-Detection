# Autism-Level-Detection

## Autism Spectrum Disorder Detection - Early Stages

This repository contains the beginnings of a machine learning model aimed at detecting the level of autism in individuals. Please note that this project is in its **very early stages** and the model is not yet ready for use.

**Current Status:**

* **Data Collection:** We are currently in the process of gathering and cleaning relevant data for training the model. This includes persistent difficulties in social interactionc persistent difficulties in social communication, stereotypic (rigid and repetitive) behaviors, resistance to change or restricted interests, and Probability in obtaining or sustaining employment or education, Type of job, Fine motor skills, Gross Motor Skills, Ability to follow instructions, Ability to work in a group, difficulties in initiating or sustaining social relationships, previous or current contact with mental health or learning disability services ,comorbidity, Sensory factors, Communication problem- verbal, semi verbal, non verbal, Retention of skills

* **Model Development:** We are exploring different machine learning approaches and architectures to identify the most effective model for this task. 
* **Evaluation:**  We are establishing appropriate metrics and procedures for evaluating the model's performance.

**Goals:**

* Develop a reliable machine learning model capable of accurately detecting the level of autism.

**Challenges:**

* **Data Availability:** Accessing large, diverse, and high-quality datasets for autism research can be challenging.
* **Model Complexity:** Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental condition, and capturing its nuances in a machine learning model is a significant undertaking.
* **Ethical Considerations:** Ensuring fairness, privacy, and responsible use of the model are crucial priorities.

**Future Work:**

* Continue data collection and preprocessing.
* Experiment with various machine learning models and feature engineering techniques.
* Implement rigorous evaluation procedures.
* Explore potential biases and address ethical concerns.
* Develop a user-friendly interface for the model.


**Disclaimer:**

This model is a work in progress and should not be used for diagnostic purposes. We are not responsible for any consequences arising from the use of this model.
